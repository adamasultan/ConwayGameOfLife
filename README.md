# ConwayGameOfLife
Project based on Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a simulation that has a few simple rules.

1. There is a grid of evenly sized squares
2. Each square can either be alive or dead
3. Each square will interact with the 8 squares surrounding once every generation (every turn)
4. Any alive cell with less than 2 of its neighbor being alive, dies.
5. Any alive cell with 2 or 3 alive neighbors lives on to the next generation.
6. Any alive cell with more than 3 alive neighbors dies.
7. Any dead cell with exactly 3 alive neighbors, becomes alive

This is a game where the user can input any combination alive or dead cells and simulate multiple generations of the Game of Life.
